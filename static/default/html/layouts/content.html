{% if not embedded_in_json %}
  {#
    This is the end of the first "if not embedded_in_json" section, which
    simply skips all the boilerplate HTML so snippets can be injected
    using innerHTML. Sub-templates may also need to check for this variable.

  {# Boilerplate starts again, continues until /html. #}
